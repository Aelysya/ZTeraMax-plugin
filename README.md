## How to use

First, it is highly recommended that you use a datapack that you can find [here](https://github.com/PokemonWorkshop/GameDataPacks/tree/gen-packs). Many of the data used in this plugin are erroneous in the base data of a default Studio project, so most of the functionalities will simply not work.

### Z-Moves

When you give a crystal to your players, be sure to give them the ones that contain a '2' at the end (e.g. normalium_z2). In the database these are the bigger crystals.
When the players choose to give a crystal to their Pokémon, it will automatically create the right crystal, which is the smaller version in the database.
When they try to retrieve the crystal from their Pokémon, it will not be put back in the bag, just deleted. This mimics the ways these items work in the official games.
